Hi there!  I'm Dave, a software guy.  I'm a long-time programmer - I learned to spell from Sierra's King's Quest, began writing text adventures in GWBASIC on my school's computer when I was 11, and wrote a lot of QBASIC text adventure games in junior high.  In high school I wrote some RPG frameworks in Visual Basic (just the framework, I never finished any games).  In college, I wasted an incredible amount in time [programming MUSHCode](http://www.mushcode.com/), and in grad school I spent my burnout time [programming a chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/apep-chess-engine).  Nowadays I work from home for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com).

It often feels a cosmic joke that all these trivial childhood obsessions led me to a career and a pretty good life beyond that.  I'm a runner, a [Dinosaur Jr. superfan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGDtxuvfWKA), and an all-time father.  Life is busy but it's always kind of wonderful.

Outside of work, I learn [algebraic number theory](https://github.com/tildedave/marcus-solutions), futz with [cryptopals](https://github.com/tildedave/cryptopals-set8) and [Advent of Code](https://github.com/tildedave/advent-of-code), and hack on a new [chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/ra-chess-engine).  I try to [read](https://tildedave.com/reading.html) when I can.
