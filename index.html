Hi there, I'm Dave, a software guy.  University of Illinois class of 2003, finished my PhD thesis at Penn State in 2009.  I live in Durham, North Carolina.  Husband, father, geek.

I'm a long-time programmer - I began programming when I was 8 writing text adventures in GWBASIC on my school's computer.  In junior high I wrote text adventure games in QBASIC.  In high school I wrote some RPG frameworks in Visual Basic (just the framework, I never finished any games).  In college I wrote MUSHcode for PennMUSH including the guts of an extremely involved space system (in true MUSH fashion, I'm pretty sure it never had any users).  In grad school I got pretty burned out and wrote a [chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/apep-chess-engine) (that crashed a bunch).  Nowadays I work from home for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/).

I'm a new father, so my current main focus is absorbing liquids into my clothes.  When I have some time I try to learn number theory, futz with [cryptopals](https://github.com/tildedave/cryptopals-set8), and hack on a [new chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/ra-chess-engine).  I'm a [Dinosaur Jr. superfan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGDtxuvfWKA).
