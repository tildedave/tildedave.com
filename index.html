Hi there, I'm Dave, a software guy.  University of Illinois class of 2003, finished my PhD thesis at Penn State in 2009.  Lived in Blacksburg, Virginia from 2009 - 2014, and the Bay Area from 2014 - 2021.  I currently live in Durham, North Carolina.

I'm a long-time programmer - I learned to spell from Sierra's King's Quest, began writing text adventures in GWBASIC on my school's computer when I was 11, and wrote a lot of QBASIC in junior high.  In high school I wrote some RPG frameworks in Visual Basic (just the framework, I never finished any games).  Nowadays I work from home for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com).  It often feels like a bit of a cosmic joke that all these trivial childhood obsessions led me to a career and a pretty good life beyond that.

When I have some time outside of work, I learn number theory, futz with [cryptopals](https://github.com/tildedave/cryptopals-set8), and hack on a [chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/ra-chess-engine).  I'm a [Dinosaur Jr. superfan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGDtxuvfWKA).  I'm a sometimes runner, a sometimes backpacker, and an all-time father.  Life is busy but it's always kind of wonderful.
