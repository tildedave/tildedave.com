Hi there, I'm Dave, a software person.  I grew up in New Jersey, went to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, then went to Penn State for grad school.  I've lived in Blacksburg, Oakland, and now I live in Durham, North Carolina.

I'm a long-time programmer - I began programming when I was 8 writing text adventures in GWBASIC on my school's computer.  In junior high I wrote text adventure games in QBASIC.  In high school I wrote some RPG frameworks in Visual Basic.  In college I wrote MUSHcode for PennMUSH including the guts of an extremely involved space system.  In grad school I wrote a [chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/apep-chess-engine).  The [day job](https://chartio.com/) tends to be some combination of JavaScript, Python, and Java - all objectively better technologies, all far less fun.

In my spare time I <a href="reading.html">read</a>, exercise, and backpack.  Some out-of-work hobbies are learning number theory and hacking on a [new chess engine](https://github.com/tildedave/ra-chess-engine).
