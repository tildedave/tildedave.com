Last year I joined some team members doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in the month of December.  I finished all the 2023 puzzles and started working through 2019.  After I finished 2019 I started on 2022.  And so on.  I'm done with all of the older years; 225 "puzzle scenarios", each with two parts.

The "hook" of Advent of Code is that the starting days are pretty easy and can usually be done in 10-20 minutes.  The puzzles tend to be familiar computer science stuff: string parsing, navigating mazes, graph algorithms, though there's usually an unexpected twist along the way.  It's a great introduction to the coolest parts of our field.

However, after day 15, the puzzles tend to ramp up in difficulty.  I'd drink a glass of red wine and try to puzzle my way through getting [4x4 puzzle pieces to line up](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20) or [navigating a maze on the surface of a 3d cube](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22).  Of course, the point isn't to solve these problems the fastest or best - there are people on Reddit doing these problems using APL!  I did most my problems on a 10 year old laptop, generally didn't care about performance, and never really tried to use any kind of parallelism.  I was mostly aiming for the code to "feel good", and I feel pretty good about where I landed.

I did most of the years in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), a language I can _finally_ say I'm comfortable in.  Along the way I got very familiar with [reduce](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce) (and its friends [reduced](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduced) and [reductions](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reductions)), [threading](https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros), [destructuring](https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring), and lazy infinite sequences, frequently created through [iterate](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/iterate) and navigated with a reducer.  Clojure isn't a perfect language for Advent of Code; every year tends to have a linked list problem that's trivial using Python's [deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) but ends up a giant pain in a language with immutable data structures.  But there's really nothing like programming business logic in a Lisp, and before getting back into it this year I had forgotten how much I really loved Lisp.  I've really come a long way from struggling with alpha-beta search in the game [mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) back in UIUC's Intro to Artificial Intelligence course.

Finally, it's been wonderful to feed the part of me that's been dormant for a little while after the last two years of childcare.  The constant interruptions have forced me towards very atomic interests.  Read a book five pages at a time, watch a YouTube videos but assume you'll have to put it down in 10 minutes, replay a video game for the fifteenth time before baby bedtime.  Being able to find the time for this kind of hobby in the middle of the rest of my life has been wonderful.
