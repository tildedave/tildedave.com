I started keeping track of the books I've read in 2018.  Added a bunch of other ones from memory.

I got really into history around 2010 which started with various histories of Rome, progressed to medieval European history, read way too much about World War 2, and read a bunch of American history during COVID and after.  I love a good sit down to get lost in a totally different world.

COVID lockdown seems to have re-activated the reading circuits.  Lately (2021-2024) I have been trying to read genre fiction, mainly modern science fiction.
