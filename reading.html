I started keeping track of the books I've read in 2018.  Added a bunch of other ones from memory.

I got really into history around 2010 which started with various histories of Rome, progressed to medieval European history.  I've now settled on 19th Century European as my "favorite" period in the past to read about.

COVID lockdown seems to have re-activated the reading circuits.
