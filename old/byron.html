    <title>The Story of Byron the Bulb</title>
  </head>

<p><font size="-2">Now it turns out that this light bulb over the colonel's head 
  here is the same identical Osram light bulb that Franz Pokier used to sleep 
  next to in his bunk at the underground rocket works at Nordhausen. Statistically 
  (so Their story goes), every n-thousandth light bulb is gonna be perfect, all 
  the delta-q's piling up just right, so we shouldn't be surprised that this one's 
  still around, burning brightly. But the truth is even more stupendous. This 
  bulb is immortal! It's been around, in fact, since the twenties, has that old-timery 
  point at the tip and is less pear-shaped than more contemporary bulbs. Wotta 
  history, this bulb, if only it could speak&#8212;well, as a matter of fact, 
  it can speak. It is dic-tating the muscular modulations of Paddy McGonigle's 
  cranking tonight, this is a loop here, with feedback through Paddy to the generator 
  again. Here it is,</font></p>
<h1><B>THE STORY OF BYRON THE BULB</B></h1>
<p>Byron was to've been manufactured by Tungsram in Budapest. He would probably 
  have been grabbed up by the ace salesman Geza Rozsavolgyi's father Sandor, who 
  covered all the Transylvanian territory and had begun to go native enough to 
  where the home office felt vaguely paranoid about him throwing some horrible 
  spell on the whole operation if they didn't give him what he wanted. Actually 
  he was a salesman who wanted his son to be a doctor, and that came true. But 
  it may have been the bad witch-leery auras around Budapest that got the birth 
  of Byron reassigned at the last minute to Osram, in Berlin. Reassigned, yes. 
  There is a Bulb Baby Heaven, amiably sati-rized as if it was the movies or something, 
  well Big <em>Business</em>, ha, ha! But don't let Them fool you, this <em>is</em> 
  a bureaucracy first, and a Bulb Baby Heaven only as a sort of sideline. All 
  overhead&#8212;yes, out of its own pocket the Company is springing for square 
  leagues of organdy, hogsheads of IG Farben pink and blue Baby Dye, hundredweights 
  of clever Siemens Electric Baby Bulb Pacifiers, giving the suckling Bulb the 
  shape of a 110-volt current without the least trickle of power. One way or another, 
  these Bulb folks are in the business of providing the appearance of power, power 
  against the night, without the reality.</p>

<p>Actually, B.B.H. is rather shabby. The brown rafters drip cobwebs. Now and 
  then a roach shows up on the floor, and all the Babies try to roll over to look 
  (being Bulbs they <em>seem</em> perfectly symmetrical, Skippy, but don't forget 
  the contact at the top of the thread) going uh-guh! uhhhh-<em>guh</em>!, glowing 
  feebly at the bewildered roach sitting paralyzed and squashable out on the bare 
  boards, rushing, reliving the terror of some sudden blast of current out of 
  nowhere and high overhead the lambent, all-seeing Bulb. In their innocence, 
  the Baby Bulbs don't know what to make of this roach's abreaction&#8212;they 
  feel his fright, but don't know what it is. They just want to be his friend. 
  He's interesting and has good moves. Everybody's excited except for Byron, who 
  con-siders the other Bulb Babies a bunch of saps. It is a constant struggle 
  to turn their thoughts on anything meaningful. Hi there Babies, I'm Byron-the-Bulb! 
  Here to sing a little song to you, that goes&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>Light-up, and-shine, you&#8212;in-cande-scent Bulb Ba-bies!<br>
Looks-like ya got ra-bies<br>
Just lay there foamin' and a-screamin' like a buncha little demons,<br>
I'm deliv'rin' unto you a king-dom of roa-ches, And no-thin' ap-proaches<br>
That joyful feelin' when-you're up-on the ceilin' <br>
Lookin' down&#8212;night and day&#8212;on the king-dom you sur-vey, <br>
They'll come out 'n' love ya till the break of dawn, <br>
But they run like hell when that light comes on! <br>
So shine on, Baby Bulbs, you're the wave of the fu-ture, <br>
And I'm here to recruit ya, <br>
In m'great crusade,<br>
Just sing along Babies&#8212;come-on-and-join-the-big-pa-rade!
</blockquote>
<p>Trouble with Byron's he's an old, old soul, trapped inside the glass prison 
  of a Baby Bulb. He hates this place, lying on his back waiting to get manufactured, 
  nothing to listen to on the speakers but Charleston music, now and then an address 
  to the Nation, what kind of a set-up's that? Byron wants to get out of here 
  and into it, needless to say he's been developing all kinds of nervous ailments, 
  Baby Bulb Diaper Rash, which is a sort of corrosion on his screw threads, Bulb 
  Baby Colic, a tight spasm of high resistance someplace among the deep loops 
  of tungsten wire, Bulb Baby Hyperventilation, where it actually feels like his 
  vacuum's been broken though there is no organic basis. . . .</p>
<p>When M-Day finally does roll around, you can bet Byron's elated. He has passed 
  the time hatching some really insane grandiose plans&#8212; he's gonna organize 
  all the Bulbs, see, get him a power base in Berlin, he's already hep to the 
  Strobing Tactic, all you do is develop the knack (Yogic, almost) of shutting 
  off and on at a rate close to the human brain's alpha rhythm, and you can actually 
  trigger an <em>epileptic fit</em>! True. Byron has had a vision against the 
  rafters of his ward, of 20 million Bulbs, all over Europe, at a given synchronizing 
  pulse arranged by one of his many agents in the Grid, all these Bulbs beginning 
  to strobe <em>together</em>, humans thrashing around the 20 million rooms like 
  fish on the beaches of Perfect Energy&#8212;Attention, humans, this has been 
  a warning to you. Next time, a few of us will <em>explode</em>. Ha-ha. Yes 
  we'll unleash our <em>Kamikaze squads</em>! You've heard of the Kirghiz Light? 
  well that's the ass end of a firefly compared to what we're gonna&#8212;oh, 
  you haven't heard of the&#8212;oh, well, too bad. Cause a few Bulbs, say a million, 
  a mere 5% of our number, are more than willing to flame out in one grand burst 
  instead of patiently waiting out their design hours. ... So Byron dreams of 
  his Guerrilla Strike Force, gonna get Herbert Hoover, Stanley Baldwin, all of 
  them, right in the face with one coordinated blast. . . .</p>

<p>Is Byron in for a rude awakening! There is already an organization, a human 
  one, known as &quot;Phoebus,&quot; the international light-bulb cartel, headquartered 
  in Switzerland. Run pretty much by International GE, Osram, and Associated Electrical 
  Industries of Britain, which are in turn owned 100%, 29% and 46%, respectively, 
  by the General Electric Company in America. Phoebus fixes the prices and determines 
  the operational lives of all the bulbs in the world, from Brazil to Japan to 
  Holland (although Philips in Holland is the mad dog of the cartel, apt at any 
  time to cut loose and sow disaster throughout the great Combi-nation). Given 
  this state of general repression, there seems noplace for a newborn Baby Bulb 
  to start but at the bottom.</p>
<p>But Phoebus doesn't know yet that Byron is immortal. He starts out his career 
  at an all-girl opium den in Charlottenburg, almost within sight of the statue 
  of Wernher Siemens, burning up in a sconce, one among many bulbs witnessing 
  the more languorous forms of Republican decadence. He gets to know all the bulbs 
  in the place, Benito the Bulb over in the next sconce who's always planning 
  an escape, Bernie down the hall in the toilet, who has all kinds of urolagnia 
  jokes to tell, his mother Brenda in the kitchen who talks of hashish hush puppies, 
  dildos rigged to pump floods of paregoric orgasm to the cap-illaries of the 
  womb, prayers to Astarte and Lilith, queen of the night, reaches into the true 
  Night of the Other, cold and naked on linoleum floors after days without sleep, 
  the dreams and tears become a natural state. . . .</p>
<p>One by one, over the months, the other bulbs burn out, and are gone. The first 
  few of these hit Byron hard. He's still a new arrival, still hasn't accepted 
  his immortality. But on through the burning hours he starts to learn about the 
  transience of others: learns that loving them while they're here becomes easier, 
  and also more intense&#8212;to love as if each design-hour will be the last. 
  Byron soon enough becomes a Permanent Old-Timer. Others can recognize his immortality 
  on sight, but it's never discussed except in a general way, when folklore comes 
  flickering in from other parts of the Grid, tales of the Immortals, one in a 
  kabbalist's study in Lyons who's supposed to know magic, another in Norway outside 
  a warehouse facing arctic whiteness with a stoicism more southerly bulbs begin 
  strobing faintly just at the thought of. If other Immortals are out there, they 
  remain silent. But it is a silence with much, perhaps, everything, in it.</p>
<p>After Love, then, Byron's next lesson is Silence.</p>
<p>As his burning lengthens toward 600 hours, the monitors in Switzerland begin 
  to keep more of an eye on Byron. The Phoebus Surveillance Room is located under 
  a little-known Alp, a chilly room crammed full of German electro hardware, glass, 
  brass, ebonite, and silver, massive terminal blocks shaggy with copper clips 
  and screws, and a cadre of superclean white-robed watchers who wander meter 
  to meter, light as snowdevils, making sure that nothing's going wrong, that 
  through no bulb shall the mean operating life be extended. You can imagine what 
  it would do to the market if <em>that</em> started happening.</p>

<p>Byron passes Surveillance's red-line at 600 hours, and immediately, as a matter 
  of routine, he is checked out for filament resistance, burning temperature, 
  vacuum, power consumption. Everything's normal. Now Byron is to be checked out 
  every 50 hours hereafter. A soft chime will go off in the monitoring station 
  whenever it's time.</p>
<p>At 800 hours&#8212;another routine precaution&#8212;a Berlin agent is sent 
  out to the opium den to transfer Byron. She is wearing asbestos-lined kid gloves 
  and seven-inch spike heels, no not so she can fit in with the crowd, but so 
  that she can reach that sconce to unscrew Byron. The other bulbs watch, in barely 
  subdued terror. The word goes out along the Grid. At something close to the 
  speed of light, every bulb, Azos looking down the empty black Bakelite streets, 
  Nitralampen and Wotan Gs at night soccer matches, Just-Wolframs, Monowatts and 
  Siriuses, every bulb in Europe knows what's happened. They are silent with impotence, 
  with surrender in the face of struggles they thought were all myth. <em>We can't 
  help</em>, this common thought humming through pastures of sleeping sheep, down 
  Autobahns and to the bitter ends of coaling piers in the North, <em>there's 
  never been anything we could do</em>. . . . Anyone shows us the meanest hope 
  of transcending and the Committee on Incandescent Anomalies comes in and takes 
  him away. Some do protest, maybe, here and there, but it's only information, 
  glow-modulated, harmless, nothing close to the explosions in the faces of the 
  powerful that Byron once envisioned, back there in his Baby ward, in his innocence.</p>
<p>He is taken to Neukolln, to a basement room, the home of a glass-blower who 
  is afraid of the night and who will keep Byron glowing and on watch over all 
  the flint bowls, the griffins and flower-ships, ibexes in mid-leap, green spider-webs, 
  somber ice-deities. This is one of many so-called &quot;control points,&quot; 
  where suspicious bulbs can be monitored easily.</p>
<p>In less than a fortnight, a gong sounds along the ice and stone corridors of 
  the Phoebus headquarters, and faces swivel over briefly from their meters. Not 
  too many gongs around here. Gongs are special. Byron has passed 1000 hours, 
  and the procedure now is standard: the Committee on Incandescent Anomalies sends 
  a hit man to Berlin.</p>

<p>But here something odd happens. Yes, damned odd. The plan is to smash up Byron 
  and send him back right there in the shop to cullet and batch&#8212;salvage 
  the tungsten, of course&#8212;and let him be reincarnated in the glassblower's 
  next project (a balloon setting out on a journey from the top of a white skyscraper). 
  This wouldn't be too bad a deal for Byron&#8212;he knows as well as Phoebus 
  does how many hours he has on him. Here in the shop he's watched enough glass 
  being melted back into the structureless pool from which all glass forms spring 
  and re-spring, and wouldn't mind going through it himself. But he is trapped 
  on the Karmic wheel. The glowing orange batch is a taunt, a cruelty. There's 
  no escape for Byron, he's doomed to an infinite regress of sockets and bulbsnatchers. 
  In zips young Hansel Geschwindig, a Weimar street urchin&#8212;twirls Byron 
  out of the ceiling into a careful pocket and Gesssschhhhwindig! out the door 
  again. Darkness invades the dreams of the glassblower. Of all the unpleasantries 
  his dreams grab in out of the night air, an extinguished light is the worst. 
  Light, in his dreams, was always hope: the basic, mortal hope. As the contacts 
  break helically away, hope turns to darkness, and the glassblower wakes sharply 
  tonight crying, &quot;Who? <em>Who?</em>''</p>
<p>Phoebus isn't exactly thrown into a frenzy. It's happened before. There is 
  still a procedure to follow. It means more overtime for some employees, so there's 
  that vague, full-boweled pleasure at the windfall, along with an equally vague 
  excitement at the break in routine. You want high emotion, forget Phoebus. Their 
  stonefaced search parties move out into the streets. They know more or less 
  where in the city to look. They are assuming that no one among their consumers 
  knows of Byron's immortality. So the data for Now-immortal Bulbsnatchings ought 
  to apply also to Byron. And the data happen to hump up in poor sections, Jewish 
  sections, drug, homosexual, prostitute, and magic sections of the capital. 
  Here are the most logical bulbsnatchers, in terms of what the crime is. Look 
  at all the propaganda. It's a <em>moral</em> crime. Phoebus discovered&#8212;one 
  of the great undiscovered discoveries of our time&#8212;that consumers need 
  to feel a sense of sin. That guilt, in proper invisible hands, is a most powerful 
  weapon. In America, Lyle Bland and his psychologists had figures, expert testimony 
  and money (money in the Puritan sense&#8212;an outward and visible O.K. on their 
  intentions) enough to tip the Discovery of Guilt at the cusp between scientific 
  theory and fact. Growth rates in later years were to bear Bland out (actually 
  what bore Bland out was an honorary pallbearer sextet of all the senior members 
  of Salitieri, Poore, Nash, De Brutus and Short, plus Lyle, Jr., who was sneezing. 
  Buddy at the last minute decided to go see <em>Dracula</em>. He was better off). 
  Of all the legacies Bland left around, the Bulbsnatching Heresy was perhaps 
  his grandest. It doesn't just mean that somebody isn't buying a bulb. It also 
  means that same somebody is not putting any power in that socket! It is a sin 
  both against Phoebus and against the Grid. Neither one is about to let <em>that</em> 
  get out of hand. So, out go the Phoebus flatfoots, looking for the snatched 
  Byron. But the urchin has already left town, gone to Hamburg, traded Byron to 
  a Reeperbahn <em>prostitute</em> so he can <em>shoot up some morphine</em>&#8212;the 
  young woman's customer tonight is a cost-accountant who likes to have light 
  bulbs <em>screwed into his asshole</em>, and this John has also brought a little 
  <em>hashish to smoke</em>, so by the time he leaves he's forgotten about Byron 
  still there in his asshole&#8212;doesn't ever, in fact, find out, because when 
  he finally gets around to sitting down (having stood up in trolleys all the 
  way home) it's on his own home toilet and plop! there goes Byron in the water 
  and flusssshhhh! away down the waste lines to the Elbe estuary. He is just round 
  enough to get through smoothly all the way. For days he floats over the North 
  Sea, till he reaches Helgoland, that red-and-white Napoleon pastry tipped in 
  the sea. He stays there for a while at a hotel between the Hengst and the Monch, 
  till being brought back one day to the mainland by a very old priest who's been 
  put hep to Byron's immortality in the course of a routine dream about the taste 
  of a certain 1911 Hochheimer . . . suddenly here's the great Berlin Eispalast, 
  a booming, dim iron-trussed cavern, the smell of women in the blue shadows&#8212;perfumes, 
  leathers, fur skating-costumes, ice-dust in the air, flashing legs, jutting 
  haunches, desire in grippelike flashes, helplessness at the end of a crack-the-whip, 
  rocketing through beams of sunlight choked with the powdered ice, and a voice 
  in the blurred mirror underfoot saying, &quot;Find the one who has performed 
  this miracle. He is a saint. Expose him. Expedite his canonization. ...&quot; 
  The name is on a list the old man presently draws up of about a thousand tourists 
  who've been in and out of Helgoland since Byron was found on the beach. The 
  priest begins a search by train, footpath, and Hispano-Suiza, checking out each 
  of the tourists on his list. But he gets no farther than Nurnberg, where his 
  valise, with Byron wrapped inside in an alb, is ripped off by a transsectite, 
  a Lutheran named Mausmacher who likes to dress up in Roman regalia. This Mausmacher, 
  not content with standing in front of his own mirror making papal crosses, thinks 
  it will be a really bizarre kick to go out to the Zeppelin field to a Nazi torchlight 
  rally in full drag, and walk around blessing people at random. Green torches 
  flaring, red swastikas, twinkling brasses and Father Mausmacher, checking out 
  tits 'n' asses, waistlines 'n' baskets, humming a clerical little tune, some Bach 
  riff, smiling as he moves through the Sieg Heils and choruses of &quot;Die Fahne 
  Hoch.&quot; Unknown to him, Byron slides out of the stolen vestments onto the 
  ground. He is then walked past by several hundred thousand boots and shoes, 
  and not one so much as brushes him, natch. He is scavenged next day (the field 
  now deathempty, columned, pale, streaked with long mudpuddles, morning clouds 
  lengthening behind the gilded swastika and wreath) by a poor Jewish ragpicker, 
  and taken on, on into another 15 years of preservation against chance and against 
  Phoebus. He will be screwed into mother (<em>Mutter</em>) after mother, as the 
  female threads of German light-bulb sockets are known, for some reason that 
  escapes everybody.</p>

<p>The cartel have already gone over to Contingency Plan B, which assumes a seven-year 
  statute of limitations, after which Byron will be considered legally burned 
  out. Meanwhile, the personnel taken off of Byron's case are busy tracking a 
  long-lived bulb that once occupied a socket on the porch of an army outpost 
  in the Amazon jungle, Beatriz the Bulb, who has just been stolen, mysteriously, 
  by an Indian raiding party.</p>
<p>Through his years of survival, all these various rescues of Byron happen as 
  if by accident. Whenever he can, he tries to instruct any bulbs nearby in the 
  evil nature of Phoebus, and in the need for solidarity against the cartel. 
  He has come to see how Bulb must move beyond its role as conveyor of light-energy 
  alone. Phoebus has restricted Bulb to this one identity. &quot;But there are 
  other frequencies, above and below the visible band. Bulb can give heat. Bulb 
  can provide energy for plants to grow, illegal plants, inside closets, for example. 
  Bulb can penetrate the sleeping eye, and operate among the dreams of men.&quot; 
  Some bulbs listened attentively&#8212;others thought of ways to fink to Phoebus. 
  Some of the older anti-Byronists were able to fool with their parameters in 
  systematic ways that would show up on the ebonite meters under the Swiss mountain: 
  there were even a few self-immolations, hoping to draw the hit men down.</p>
<p>Any talk of Bulb's transcendence, of course, was clear subversion. Phoebus 
  based everything on bulb efficiency&#8212;the ratio of the usable power coming 
  out, to the power put in. The Grid demanded that this ratio stay as small as 
  possible. That way they got to sell more juice. On the other hand, low efficiency 
  meant longer burning hours, and that cut into bulb sales for Phoebus. In the 
  beginning Phoebus tried increasing filament resistance, reducing the hours of 
  life on the sly and gradually&#8212;till the Grid noticed a fall-off in revenues, 
  and started screaming. The two parties by and by reached an accord on a compromise 
  bulb-life figure that would bring in enough money for both of them, and to go 
  fifty-fifty on the costs of the antibulbsnatching campaign. Along with a more 
  subtle attack against those criminal souls who forswear bulbs entirely and use 
  candles. Phoebus's long-standing arrangement with the Meat Cartel was to restrict 
  the amount of tallow in circulation by keeping more fat in meat to be sold regardless 
  of cardiac problems that might arise, and redirecting most of what was trimmed 
  off into soap production. Soap in those days was a booming concern. Among the 
  consumers, the Bland Institute had discovered deep feelings about shit. Even 
  at that, meat and soap were minor interlocks to Phoebus. More important were 
  items like tungsten. Another reason why Phoebus couldn't cut down bulb life 
  too far. Too many tungsten filaments would eat into available stockpiles of 
  the metal&#8212;China being the major world source, this also brought in very 
  delicate questions of Eastern policy&#8212;and disturb the arrangement be-tween 
  General Electric and Krupp about how much tungsten carbide would be produced, 
  where and when and what the prices would be. The guidelines settled on were 
  $37-$90 a pound in Germany, $200-$400 a pound in the U.S. This directly governed 
  the production of machine tools, and thus all areas of light and heavy industry. 
  When the War came, some people thought it unpatriotic of GE to have given Germany 
  an edge like that. But nobody with any power. Don't worry.</p>
<p> Byron, as he burns on, sees more and more of this pattern. He learns how to 
  make contact with other kinds of electric appliances, in homes, in factories 
  and out in the streets. Each has something to tell him. The pattern gathers 
  in his soul (<em>Seek</em>, as the core of the earlier carbon filament was known 
  in Germany), and the grander and clearer it grows, the more desperate Byron 
  gets. Someday he will know everything, and still be as impotent as before. His 
  youthful dreams of organizing all the bulbs in the world seem impossible now&#8212;the 
  Grid is wide open, all messages can be overheard, and there are more than enough 
  traitors out on the line. Prophets traditionally don't last long&#8212;they 
  are either killed outright, or given an accident serious enough to make them 
  stop and think, and most often they do pull back. But on Byron has been visited 
  an even better fate. He is condemned to go on forever, knowing the truth and 
  powerless to change anything. No longer will he seek to get off the wheel. His 
  anger and frustration will grow without limit, and he will find himself, poor 
  perverse bulb, enjoying it. ... </p>
